# CustomHashMapImplentation
This is a creation of a custom hashmap as a project for my Data structures and algorithm class. This project helped me understand what a hashmap is and how it works. As well, I am gaining experience in debugging a hashmap. The assignment used Linux redirection on the command prompt in Visual Studio code.
